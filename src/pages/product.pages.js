        Driving consumer demand in advance of a product coming to market increases the "pull effect" by
        encouraging shoppers to start asking for the product and retailers to pre-order, thus "pulling"
        the product through their distribution channels.

        A successful product launch drives excitement, interest, and new business leads, which creates a 
        sales funnel, where prospects, fans, and referrals can begin their journey towards purchase.
        Most CEOs believe that if only the market understood their new product, theyâ€™d buy it immediately. 
        Developing a product narrative early could not only drive the marketing plan, it may also influence
        design or manufacturing.
